# PrivacyAmplification

Unified, Tight, and Fast Privacy Amplification in the Shuffle Model of Differential Privacy

To compute tight privacy amplification upper bound, call:
<strong>amplificationUB(p, beta, q0, q1, n, delta, T, step)</strong>
for most local randomizers, q0=q1=q, except 2-RR and exponential mechanism for metric privacy


To compute tight privacy amplification lower bound, call:
<strong>amplificationLB(p, beta, q0, q1, n, delta, T, step)</strong>
